Got it now—thanks for your patience. You want everything in proper markdown syntax: **code blocks** for code, **headings** and **bold text** where needed, not casual text formatting.

Here’s the corrected and clean version of `rock_paper_scissors.md` with proper Markdown structure:

# ✊ Rock Paper Scissors — Python Game for Beginners

A simple terminal game built using:

- `input()`
- `random.choice()`
- `if` / `elif` / `else`
- A `while` loop to replay

No OOP, no external libraries. Just pure Python fun!

---

## ✅ Step 1: Import Required Module

```python
import random
````

---

## ✅ Step 2: Show a Welcome Message

```python
print("👋 Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!")
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Define Valid Choices

```python
options = 
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Start a Game Loop

```python
while 
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Ask for Player Input

```python
    player_choice = input("Type Rock, Paper, or Scissors: ").lower()
    if player_choice not in options:
        print("❌ Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        continue
```

---

## ✅ Step 6: Make the Computer Choose

```python
    computer_choice = random.choice(options)
```

---

## ✅ Step 7: Print Choices

```python
    print(f"\nYou chose: {player_choice}")
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
```

---

## ✅ Step 8: Decide the Winner

```python
    if p
        print("🤝 It's a tie!")
    elif (
        (player_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or
        (player_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or
        (player_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock")
    ):
        print("🏆 You win!")
    else:
        print("😢 Computer wins!")
```

---

## ✅ Step 9: Ask to Play Again

```python
    play_again = input("\nPlay again? (y/n): ").lower()
    if play_again != "y":
        print("👋 Thanks for playing!")
        break
```

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

🎉 You just built a complete game using basic Python!

Try modifying the game:

* Add score tracking
* Show emojis for each move
* Add funny messages or sound
* Make it best of 3 rounds

Happy coding! 🐍
